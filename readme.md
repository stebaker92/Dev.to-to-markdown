# Python Dev.to Post Downloader
Python script to download all of your Dev.to posts in markdown format.

I Created this script to import my Dev.to posts into my self hosted blog

## Usage
- Create a dev.to API KEY and put it in a `.env` file (or rename `.env.example`)
- Install python requirements `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `python3 dev.to.py` to download all posts to a `posts/` directory
